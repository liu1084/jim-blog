/**
 * A replacement utility for internationalization very similar to sprintf.
 *
 * @param replace {mixed} The tokens to replace depends on type
 *  string: all instances of $0 will be replaced
 *  array: each instance of $0, $1, $2 etc. will be placed with each array item in corresponding order
 *  object: all attributes will be iterated through, with :key being replaced with its corresponding value
 * @return string
 *
 * @example: 'Hello :name, how are you :day'.format({ name:'John', day:'Today' })
 * @example: 'Records $0 to $1 out of $2 total'.format(['10', '20', '3000'])
 * @example: '$0 agrees to all mentions $0 makes in the event that $0 hits a tree while $0 is driving drunk'.format('Bob')
